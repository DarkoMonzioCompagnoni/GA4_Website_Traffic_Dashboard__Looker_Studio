# GA4 Website Traffic Dashboard on Looker Studio

From Google Analytics 4 data of the Google Merch Shop, I built an interactive dashboard on three pages:

- [Website Traffic Report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/29ebee61-94ae-41d2-a3ce-39bc56e5cf33/page/RsWTD) 
- [Section Performance Report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/29ebee61-94ae-41d2-a3ce-39bc56e5cf33/page/p_jnlvoiwu6c).
- [Channel Analysis Report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/29ebee61-94ae-41d2-a3ce-39bc56e5cf33/page/p_g6xrzx0u6c).

This dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of channel performance with visual elements such as scorecards, tables, bar charts and pie charts. 

It enables businesses to track and compare key metrics, analyze specific channels, identify high-performing channels, and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies. The filters at the top allow to visualize data for a specific time frame, country, or channel.

The dashboard updates in real-time, pulling data from the Google Merch Shop Google Analytics 4 demo profile.
